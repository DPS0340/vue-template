# Vue Template
Even better vue 2 template.

## Motivation

I cloned [vue with webpack template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) and very annoyed after an hour - they're using webpack 3, eslint 4. and ```npm start dev``` returns service - not building project. and they're using router, then why the image is in ```App.vue``` above ```<router-view>```?

I saw repository, noticed that **the repository has been deprecated.**

They are migrated into vue 3. but i think there are many reasons why people staying in vue 3. vuetify in vue 3 in only alpha, etc...

So i decided to make new template repository with my own.

## Goals

My goal is vue-template becomes Battery-included vue starter template and no having F-word in development. a kindly help very welcome.
